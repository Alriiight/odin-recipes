# odin-recipes
The current project is intented to be a recipe book, or so I believe but I'm not sure at the moment. This is an assignment within TOP. 

The skills I'll practice are html basic skills (boilerplate, editing, formatting).

First part of the project was to create a main page and then add 3 recipes. This other pages would then be linked to index.html
